<p>An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, and is used to identify a business entity. Generally, businesses need an EIN. You may apply for an EIN in various ways, and now you may apply online. This is a free service offered by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>Withholding is the tax that an employer deducts and withholds from employees’ wages every pay period.  The withholding is based on the employee’s wages during that pay period and number of dependents. When the employee calculates his income taxes for the year, the amount of taxes withheld helps determine whether a refund is issued to the taxpayer (more was withheld than necessary) or whether the taxpayer owes more in tax (less tax was withheld than necessary).The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), with state unemployment systems, provides for payments of unemployment compensation to workers who have lost their jobs. Most employers pay both a Federal and a state unemployment tax.</p>
<p>Workers’ Compensation is a form of insurance that provides wage replacement and medical benefits for employees who are injured in the course of employment, in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence.</p>
