<h3> Legal Structure  </h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Determine form of business</em></li>
<li><em>Register Business</em></li>
<li><em>Income Tax</em></li>
<li><em>Sales Tax</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When starting a business, you must decide what form of business entity to establish. Your form of business (for example, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability corporation) determines which income tax return form you have to file. The federal government levies four basic types of business taxes: income tax, self-employment tax, taxes for employers, excise taxes.</p>
<p>Nearly every state levies a business or corporate income tax. Like federal taxes, your state tax requirement depends on the legal structure of your business. For example, if your business is an LLC, the LLC is taxed separately from the owners of the business, while sole proprietors report their personal and business income taxes using the same form used to report their business taxes.</p>
