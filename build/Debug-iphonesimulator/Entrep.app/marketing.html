<h3> Marketing  </h3>
<ul>

<li><em>Sets up methods to satisfy consumer needs and wants</em></li>
<li><em>Develops strategies to allocate limited resources to create greatest return</em></li>

<p>Marketing touches every aspect of your business’s operation. It is a series of activities designed to identify customer needs and wants, and satisfy these while making a reasonable profit on a quality product or service. These activities include market research and analysis, product development, pricing, advertising, promotions, publicity, sales and customer service. Developing a marketing plan is one of the most important things you can do to ensure that your business will make a profit.</p>
<p>In order to identify your market specifically, you must determine its size, who your competitors are, and what features of your product or service will better satisfy customers. This information enables you to determine your market share and your most likely potential customers.  A customer- oriented marketing style will capture a greater market share than one centered on just the product or service. You catalog potential customers by their needs and wants. Customers can be identified according to their social demographics and geographic location. This information is basic for your research. Understanding the difference between wants and needs will help you prepare a focused plan. Needs and wants are shaped by the customer’s cultural, economic, and geographic environment.</p>
<p>Profit is the amount left after production costs and non-production costs are subtracted from gross revenue. Growth of a business can only come with reasonable profits that allow you a reasonable return on investment. In addition, some of the cash flow and profits must be turned back into the business to sustain inventories, accounts receivable, capital equipment purchases, and other assets. Depending on the nature of the business, a certain amount of asset structure is needed to support sales. The larger the sales level, the larger the asset structure needed to support the sales growth. This requires that some of the profit be returned to the business in order to sustain growth.</p>
