<h3> Business Permits </h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Ensure your business is under compliance with federal, state, and local government</em></li>
<li><em>Specific permits are required beyond basic operating license</em></li>
<li><em>Regulations vary by industry</em></li>
<li><em>Expensive fines for not complying</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Every business needs to be licensed to legally operate. Depending on your business, you may need to be licensed at the federal, state and/or local level. Beyond a basic operating license, you may need specific permits, such as an environmental permit.</p>
<p>Regulations vary by industry, state and locality, so it's very important to understand the licensing rules where your business is located. Not complying with regulations for licensing and permitting can lead to expensive fines and put your business at serious risk.</p>
