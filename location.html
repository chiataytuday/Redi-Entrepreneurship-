<h3>Location</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Most important factor when choosing your retail site.</em></li>
<li><em>Varies by business type</em></li>
<li><em>Should be based of area demographics.</em></li>
<li><em>Should be close to the competition.</em></li>

</ul>
<p>Location is usually the most important factor in choosing your site for your business. However, the site may be different based on the type of business you are wanting to place. For instance, the location of a convenience store is going to be different then the location of jewelry store. Stores that require higher traffic should be placed in locations where the demographics of the area show that there are enough people to support the area.  Specialty goods are not going to need a higher volume of traffic and thus, can be located in areas where traffic is not as big of an issue. Many people like to compare the items that they are looking to purchase at different retailers. If your business is one where your customers would want to compare prices, you should place your business in close proximity to your competitors to reduce travel time.</p>
<p>Selecting a location takes time and should coincide with loan approval. A few monthâ€™s setback is only a minor setback, and the time spent will be worth it in the long run.</p>
