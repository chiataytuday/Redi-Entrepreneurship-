<h3>Financing</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Involves obtaining adequate funds to start and run a business </em></li>
<li><em>Funding can be obtained through debt or equity financing</em></li>

</ul>
<p>Finding the right financing for your small business is one of the most important tasks during the creation of a business. In order to thrive, businesses must have adequate financing to survive the infancy and adolescence stages of your business or franchise and then thrive in adulthood. There are two types of financing: equity and debt. When looking for money, you must consider your company's debt-to-equity ratio - the relation between dollars you've borrowed and dollars you've invested in your business. The more money owners have invested in their business, the easier it is to attract financing. If your firm has a high ratio of equity to debt, you should probably seek debt financing. However, if your company has a high proportion of debt to equity, experts advise that you should increase your ownership capital (equity investment) for additional funds. That way you won't be over-leveraged to the point of jeopardizing your company's survival.</p>
<p>Most small or growth-stage businesses use limited equity financing. As with debt financing, additional equity often comes from non-professional investors such as friends, relatives, employees, customers, or industry colleagues. However, the most common source of professional equity funding comes from venture capitalists.</p>
<p>There are many sources for debt financing: banks, savings and loans, commercial finance companies, and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) are the most common. State and local governments have developed many programs in recent years to encourage the growth of small businesses in recognition of their positive effects on the economy. Family members, friends, and former associates are all potential sources, especially when capital requirements are smaller.</p>
