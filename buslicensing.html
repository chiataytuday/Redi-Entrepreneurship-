<h3> Business Licensing </h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Ensure your business is under compliance with federal, state, and local governments</em></li>
<li><em>Licenses are issued or renewed annually</em></li>
<li><em>Licenses depend upon type of business</em></li>
<li><em>Separate business license for each location of trade you are in</em></li>
</ul>
<p>One will need to choose a business entity type. The Secretary of State's office offers useful information in this area and the ability to perform many required filings online at the "Starting a Business" site. However, it is best to consult an attorney or tax advisor before filing. Downloadable forms are also available at the same site, if desired.</p>
<p>Business licensing requires verifying that you have the necessary credentials to follow a particular profession or trade in one’s area. A variety of occupations, including skilled trades and professions, require special educational credentials or licenses. These documents must be in order before a business license will be issued.</p>
<p>Trade licensing requires electricians, plumbers, gas fitters and mechanical craftsman to be tested and certified to afford competence and knowledge of the codes and of their craft. The tests used to certify trades persons are sanctioned by the building codes, and administered by a private testing firm according to a regular schedule.</p>
